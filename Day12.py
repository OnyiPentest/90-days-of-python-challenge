Day 12: Working with JSON
- Topics:
 - Learn how to parse and create JSON data using Pythonâ€™s json library.
 - Understanding JSON format and how it is used in APIs.
- Project:
 - Create a script that reads a JSON file and prints out specific values based on user input.

How It Works

The script opens and reads data.json using json.load().
It displays all the top-level keys in the JSON file to guide the user.
The user is prompted to input a key.
Based on the key:
If the value is a list, it prints all items and allows further filtering if they are dictionaries.
If the value is a dictionary, it prints all key-value pairs.
If the value is a single value (e.g., string or number), it directly prints the value
